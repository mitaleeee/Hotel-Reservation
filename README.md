# StayScape: Hotel Reservation App

StayScape is a hotel booking application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). This project applies concepts learned from various tutorials and resources, showcasing the development of a robust, secure, and scalable web application.

## Overview

StayScape is designed to provide a seamless hotel booking experience, featuring advanced search capabilities, secure user authentication, and a responsive user interface. The app leverages modern web development practices to ensure a high-quality user experience.

## Key Technological Features

### 1. MERN Stack

- **MongoDB**: Utilizes a NoSQL database to store data in flexible, JSON-like documents, enabling efficient management of extensive accommodation listings and user data.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, providing a streamlined development process for server-side logic with powerful routing and middleware capabilities.
- **React**: A declarative and component-based JavaScript library used for building the user interface, ensuring a dynamic and responsive front-end experience.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, allowing scalable network applications and efficient handling of numerous connections.

### 2. Frontend Highlights

- **CSS-Only Styling**: Utilizes pure CSS for a lightweight, fast-loading user interface without additional libraries.
- **Advanced React Components**: Implements sophisticated UI elements like a custom search bar with calendar integration and dynamic sliders using native React components.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Prioritizes accessibility and ease of use, ensuring a smooth experience for users of all tech-savviness levels.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to adapt seamlessly across devices, ensuring a consistent user experience on both desktop and mobile.

### 3. Backend Highlights

- **Comprehensive Use of Node.js and Express.js**: Handles MongoDB connections, CRUD operations, and middleware integration for a robust server-side framework.
- **Secure Authentication and Authorization**: Implements JWT-based authentication with cookies and bcrypt for password encryption, providing a secure environment for user data and transactions.
- **Efficient API Testing**: Uses Insomnia to test MongoDB operations, ensuring APIs function as expected and improving debugging and data transactions.

### 4. Security Features

- **JWT Cookies**: Combines the stateless nature of JWTs with HttpOnly cookies for secure authentication, protecting users from XSS attacks.
- **Password Encryption with bcrypt**: Enhances security by encrypting passwords before storage, safeguarding user data against unauthorized access.

## Key Components and Functionality

- **Home Page (`Home.jsx`)**: Integrates multiple React components to display featured properties, user navigation, and search functionalities.
- **Search and Filter (`List.jsx`)**: Provides advanced search capabilities with filters for destination, date range, price, and guest count.
- **Hotel Details (`Hotel.jsx`)**: Displays comprehensive information about the selected hotel, including image galleries, amenities, and booking options.
- **User Authentication (`Login.jsx`)**: Handles secure user login with JWT-based authentication and real-time session management.
